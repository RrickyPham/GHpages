            Chapter 3: The Collatz Conjecture
        </header>
        <p>
            The "Collatz Conjecture" is an infamous, or perhaps notorious, unsolved
            maths problem. It is also life. Both mine, and yours.
            <br>
            <br>
            So while it may seem strange to start at the middle- at chapter 3- as we venture
            deeper into the unsolved mystery of our lives, we will begin to appreciate it.
            <br>
            <br>
            For where we're going, there is no "beggining", "middle", and "end". Only the
            curved space-time of circular geometry. Isn't it ironic that we begin nested
            in the whirlpool of death?

        <p>My name is Ricky Pham. When I was 10 years old I "coded" for the first time.
            It was just a silly scratch game that I made for some competition that
            was shoved into my face, but for once- creation was at my fingertips. 
            <br>

            There is a kind of allure to problems. Whether they be in math, physics, or
            the universe at large. Lothar Collatz, the Collatz Conjecture's namesake, was
            born in Germany in 1910 and died in 1990. This means that he lived through both 
            World Wars. He was a man who lived, loved, and died.

            The conjecture itself is pretty simple. You start with a number, in our case: 3,
            if this number is odd then you multiply it by 3 and add 1. That is your new number.
            If your number is even, you divide it by 2. 
            <br>
            <br>
            But here's the kicker. The question: "Is there any starting number where the
            sequence does not end up in a loop?" a circle, as it were. You can do the math,
            you know how this will end, don't you? But does that rob us of the experience, the "right now"?

            The Collatz Conjecture is a whirlpool. It sucks down everyone who dares look at it
            in the eyes. And yet, insofar as art mimicks life, and mathematics is art, the Collatz
            Conjecture is life- OUR lives. Unanswered, unanswerable, and spiralling into a familiar pattern.

            To begin something is to condemn it to end.

            Yet, life never really "begins", right? Life is a cycle. And we end up where we started, eventually.

            A quote from "Song of May":
            <br>
            <br>
            "I love you like the rain.<br>
            So in joy, and in pain, <br>
            I'll hold your hand and when you're gone:<br>
            I'm sure I'll never love again."<br>
            <br>
            The letter is torn and frayed at the edges where silverfish, spiders, and 
            his fading memory have made a home in the paper. But when the oil from her
            fingertips is absorbed by the old pulp, and the page starts to crease, she puts it
            down. It is ripped, ugly, and yellow with age. It is perfect the way it is.

        <p>
            The Collatz Conjecture will not survive the death of the sun. That big flaming
            circle in the sky will eventually not have enough internal pressure to stave off the
            effects of gravity. It will collapse, and then begin to fuse heavier elements in its
            core- kickstarting an expansion that will envelop the earth. In the same way it provides
            the low entropy needed for life to exist, it will also be what brings life out. We all lose
            the battle against entropy.
        </p>
        <p>
            But you should know by now that there are no "ends" nor "begginings", just
            moving forward. Are you brave enough to live again?
